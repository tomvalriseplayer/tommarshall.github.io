010. CALLS FOR SERVICE
It is not always possible for the department to respond to every call of service; therefore, the department must organize available resources to give the highest level of efficiency possible. Determination of priority should be based upon the comparative urgency and the risk to life.

Priority order is as follows:
Bomb threats;
Hostage situations;
Distress calls;
Bank alarms;
Jewelry alarms;
Store alarms;
Property alarms;
Other calls.
