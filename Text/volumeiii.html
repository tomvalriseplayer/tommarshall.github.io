                The base radio channel (( /r )) is used for normal patrol operations by all units, it is the default radio frequency.<br>
                The TAC channels (( /tac )) can be used for specific situations that require a dedicated frequency in-order to reduce the radio clutter. It must be ended as soon as the situation is concluded.<br>

                <span class="subsection-title"><strong class="text-strong">020.10 TRAFFIC STOPS</strong></span><br>
                A traffic stop, commonly referred to as being pulled over, is a temporary detention of a driver of a vehicle to investigate a possible crime or a traffic violation of law.<br>
                <br>
                <strong class="text-strong">020.11 OFFICER'S DISCRETION</strong><br>
                Depending on the severity of the offense which the officer believes to have occurred, the officer may either issue a traffic or a verbal warning. It also depends on the amount of traffic offenses that the person has on their record.<br>
                <br>
                <strong class="text-strong">020.12 PROCEDURE</strong><br>
                Once you witness a traffic violation occurring, turn on your visual sirens (( Press N )) and sound sirens. If the driver doesn't pull over, reach for your megaphone and order them to pull over (( /b1 )).<br>
                <br>
                If the driver complies, pull over behind the stopped a vehicle in a way that the police vehicle's front right headlight is in the same line as the stopped vehicle's left backlight. If the driver doesn't comply and attempts to flee, press charges for vehicular evasion (( /su )).<br>
                <br>
                After pulling over, report the traffic stop over the radio. Example: L1, 10-86 on a red Tahoma at Idlewood. Occupied x2, C4 for now.<br>
                <br>
                After calling the traffic stop over the radio, the officer shall approach the person's vehicle on-foot and walk towards the left window. Identify yourself as a police officer and state your name as well as your rank. Ask them if they know why they have been pulled over and if they don't know why, state the reason why you've pulled them over for.<br>
                <br>
                Ask them for their vehicle registration and license, then once you have it. Call over the radio for a vehicle look up with the name of the driver. Example: L1, run a DMV check on John Doe.<br>
                <br>
                Another unit should respond with the status of the vehicle, if not, then return to your cruiser and check it yourself using the Mobile Data Computer (( /mdc )). Once you do that, hand over the documents back to the driver and issue him a ticket (( /fine )) or a verbal warning up to your discretion.<br>
                <br>
                Example of what to say in a proper order:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hello there, this is officer <strong class="text-strong">Williams</strong> from the SAPD. Do you know why I pulled you over?</li>
                    <li>I pulled you over for <strong class="text-strong">speeding</strong>. Why's that?</li>
                    <li>I need to see your driver's license and vehicle registration.</li>
                    <li>I'll get back to you in a moment.</li>
                    <li>Well, it appears that you have a clear record. So I'll let you go with a verbal warning <strong class="text-strong">OR</strong> Well, I'll have to issue you a ticket for your violation.</li>
                </ul>

                <span class="note">* The text in bold indicates that you need to replace it with your information or answers depending on the scenario.</span><br>

                <span class="subsection-title"><strong class="text-strong">020.20 FELONY STOPS</strong></span><br>
                A felony stop occurs when police stop a vehicle which has at least one occupant charged with a misdemeanor or felony. In a felony stop, officers attempt to provide their own safety by issuing instructions to maintain absolute control over every step of the proceedings.<br>
                <br>
                <strong class="text-strong">020.21 PROCEDURE</strong><br>
                Once the person that the felony stop is being performed on has pulled over, call for additional units (( /rlow )) to assist you in it. Example: L1, 10-60 on a red Tahoma at Idlewood. Occupied two times, C3.<br>
                <br>
                Upon the arrival of additional units, officers shall step out of their vehicles and provide cover to the unit giving verbal commands. The initiating unit shall be responsible for the verbal commands.<br>
                <br>
                The initiating officer shall order the suspect to cut the engine if they haven't already. Once it's done, the initiating officer shall order the suspect to take the keys out of the ignition and throw them out of the window. When the keys are out, instruct the driver to step out with hands in the air while facing the other side. After that, tell them to get on the ground.<br>
                <br>
                If there are any passengers in the vehicle, instruct them to do the same minus the key part in this order (Front passenger, Back right passenger, back left passenger). If any of them tries to run on-foot, only two officers at a maximum should chase them on-foot.<br>
                <br>
                After all of them are on the ground, officers may approach them carefully and apprehend them. Those who don't have outstanding charges on them will be let go as soon as the charged person is being transported.<br>
                <br>
                Example of what to say in a proper order:
                <ul>
                    <li>Driver, turn off the engine.</li>
                    <li>Take your keys out of the ignition and throw them out of the window.</li>
                    <li>Step out of the vehicle with hands in the air and face the opposite direction.</li>
                    <li>Get on the ground, RIGHT NOW.</li>
                </ul>

                When a unit initiates a pursuit, it should specify the vehicle and the color. In the event that a unit is detaching or attaching to the pursuit, it should inform others over the radio. Firearms may not be discharged against a vehicle unless as specified under <strong class="text-strong">Volume II, 020.50</strong> of this manual. There may only be a maximum of five vehicles in a pursuit unless instructed by a <strong class="text-strong">Sergeant I or above</strong>.<br>
                <br>
                Specialized units (SWAT | TRT) shall only become involved in pursuits involving a serious crime or a life-endangering situation, requiring at least one felony to participate. A high speed vehicle automatically occupies the role of the lead unit upon its arrival.<br>
                <br>
                When a pursued vehicle is lost, primary unit shall immediately broadcast the necessary information over the radio and discontinue the pursuit.<br>

                Units shall not parallel nor pass other units engaged in the pursuit and shall follow the rules of the road. Paralleling is defined as being positioned alongside a pursuing vehicle.<br>
                <br>
                Units may only pass other units in case they are operating a high speed vehicle or lead unit is unable to keep up with the pursued vehicle, however, it must be properly broadcasted over the radio.<br>

                The Tire Deflation Device, commonly referred to as a Spike Strip, is used to impede or stop the movement of vehicles by deflating the tires. It shall not be deployed on a stationary vehicle or vehicles without a driver.<br>
                <br>
                <span class="note">* Spike strips are also not to be used against trains as they do not work.</span><br>

                Hostage situations are situations which suspects are usually barricaded inside a property with a hostage in their custody and are making demands. The primary objective of dealing with one is to de-escalate the situation and get the hostage safe, not neutralize or apprehend the suspects.<br>
                <br>
                Hostage situations are to be dealt with by the highest ranked officer on the scene in-case of absence of a <strong class="text-strong">Police Detective</strong>. Specialized units (SWAT | TRT) may be deployed for this situation and the person in-charge of the tactical team automatically occupies the role of a tactical leader. In case that the role of detective in-charge is assumed by a <strong class="text-strong">Police Detective</strong>, the highest ranked officer still has to instruct police officers to set up perimeters and their responsibility is to ensure that nobody enters or leaves the scene without their approval. Both the highest ranked officer and tactical leader report back to the Detective in-Charge.

                Officers shall only use perimeters to block access to a certain property or area that a situation is currently active in. Those barriers must be placed in a professional manner at all times and must not be randomly placed around the scene. Barriers include police tapes, traffic cones, yellow barriers, traffic checkpoint barriers, and signs. Officers shall not trap themselves by excessive usage of barriers, leave a small gap for emergency vehicles and put a few reliable officers to guard it if needed.<br>
                <br>
                There are only two barriers that can be textured and they are marked in red:
